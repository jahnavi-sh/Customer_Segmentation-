#First, understanding the problem statement - 
#Segmentation means grouping various entities together based on certain similar properties. Here, customer segmentation means grouping 
#customers together based on similar features or properties as given in the dataset. 
#This helps companies in understanding and predicting their customersâ€™ characteristics, behaviour and needs. They can launch products or 
#enhance features accordingly. Companies can target particular sectors for more revenue. This leads to overall market enhancement of the company.  

#worflow for the project 
#1. load customer data
#2. data preprocessing 
#3. data analysis 
#4. calculate optimum number of clusters 
#5. k means clustering 
#6. visualizing the clusters 

#load libraries 
#linear algebra - for building matrices
import numpy as np 

#data preprocessing and exploration 
import pandas as pd

#data visualisation and analysis 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns 
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans 

#loading the data 
#load dataset from csv file to pandas dataframe
customer_data = pd.read_csv(r'customer_data.csv')

#we need to be familiar with the data before working on it
#view first five rows of the dataframe 
customer_data.head()
#the data contains following columns - 
#1. CustomerID - identification number alloted to the customer 
#2. Gender - Male or Female 
#3. Age 
#4. Annual Income - in k$
#5. Spending score - score alloted to the customers based on their spending habits 

#view the total number of rows and columns in the data 
#the data has 200 rows (201 data points) and 5 columns (5 features)
customer_data.shape

#more information on data structure

#check if there are any missing values 
customer_data.isnull().sum()
#there are no missing values 

#choosing annual income column and spending score column

#choosing ideal number of clusters
#this is done by calculating wcss - within cluster sum of squares
